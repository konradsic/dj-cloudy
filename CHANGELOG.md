Welcome to DJ Cloudy's release notes! Here is what you will find here
- Long description of 2 latest updates
- Short description of all other updates

## 0.9.2 release notes
This update is mainly dev-side including (third!) new logger. I personally think that this is the best one out of them, but 
What we've added:
- Complete new logger (v3, wow, I wonder how many logger versions there will be overall by the next month)
- Fixed some small bugs and issues
- We are approaching the end of fixing bugs and adding new features. Version v1.0.0 will come soon!

## 0.9.1 release notes
In this update we redefined the term 'help'. You know what it means? Look below
- Brand new help command
- Split help command to categories
*Hey! When you're here I want you to know that we will add more things like that before v1.0.0. Expect 0.9.2 to be a more dev-side update, but other will add something for the users!*
